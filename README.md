#### Scope

```
I'd like you to create a mock version of this page using responsive design. There's going to be no back end, obviously, so you can hardcode 2-3 values for vehicle make / model / year / configuration options and they don't have to be real either (Model A / Model B / Model C and Trim A / Trim B are completely fine). You don't have to use the same color scheme, layout or UI widgets as shown - the screenshot serves only to illustrate the functionality.

Some clarifications (listed here as they may influence your design):
    1) There's typically a short (up to 4) list of "preferred" vehicle makes depending on dealership (such as Ford /  Lincoln / Mercury); in 95% of all cases customer will pick one of those.
    2) Model years are sorted from newest to older; in most cases customer will pick one of 5 most recent years.
    3) Model depends on make / model year chosen and thus cannot be selected before those 2 are selected.
    4) Similarly, Vehicle Configuration (Trim) cannot be selected before make / year / model are selected.
    5) Mileage and Vehicle Configuration are optional, but customer cannot proceed to the next page until make / year / model are selected.

You can use any CSS / JS framework of your choice, if desired, but please either link them via CDN references or include the necessary files in the resulting archive you send me. Please email me the result (or let me know if you're not interested) by Wednesday, March 2nd.
